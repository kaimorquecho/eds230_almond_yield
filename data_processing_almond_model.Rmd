### Load libraries

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr) 
library(here)
```

### Create model diagram

```{r}
# model diagram
knitr::include_graphics(here("almond_model_diagram.jpg"))

```

### Read in data

```{r}
clim <- read.table(here("data","clim.txt"),header = TRUE) # read in climate data 
```

### Prepare variables to use for function implementation

```{r}
# model uses climate data from a particular month, must transform data by summarizing daily data into monthly data


# TEMPERATURE
feb_tmin <- clim %>% 
  
  # filter to month of interest
  filter(month == 2) %>%
  
  # group by year
  group_by(year) %>% 
  
   # calculate mean temp in february by year, and set column name to match function parameter
  summarize(feb_tmin = mean(tmin_c, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop") 


# PRECIPITATION
jan_precip <- clim %>%
  
  # filter to month of interest
  filter(month == 1) %>%  

  # group by year 
  group_by(year) %>%
  
  
   # calculate sum of precip in january by year, and set column name to match function parameter
  summarize(
    jan_precip = sum(precip, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop")

# bring together to have one df to pass into function 

clim <- left_join(feb_tmin, jan_precip, by = "year")


 
```

### Implement the function

```{r}
# APPLY FUNCTION using prepared data 

source(here("almond_anomaly.R"))

anomaly_results <- almond_anomaly(clim$feb_tmin, clim$jan_precip)



```
